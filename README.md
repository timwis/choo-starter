# choo-starter-app
A basic starter app for playing around with [choo](https://choo.io) on [glitch](https://glitch.com).

Since `package.json` has a `script` called `start`, glitch will run this app automatically. But if you're running this locally, you'll want to do the same thing by running `npm start` after you install dependencies via `npm install`.
